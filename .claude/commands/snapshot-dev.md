# /snapshot-dev — Mint a Development Snapshot

Mint a snapshot of the current session's completed work into the BlackBox volume so future sessions can find it via semantic + keyword search.

## How It Works

1. POST to `/chat/save` (NOT `/chat` — that wastes an LLM round-trip).
2. Backend's auto-mint trigger (`turns_threshold=1`) fires `perform_mint()` immediately.
3. `perform_mint()` generates a 3072-dim `gemini-embedding-001` embedding inline before returning, so the snapshot is searchable the moment the curl returns.
4. Snapshot ID returned in the response body.

## Default Behavior

- **Operator:** `Brandon` (NOT `Brandon-DEV` — Brandon-DEV is for sessions where the user is acting as the dev persona, but completions of work for Brandon should be saved under Brandon so his future searches find them).
- **Trigger:** invoked manually via `/snapshot-dev`, OR organically by Claude at the end of any non-trivial task per the CLAUDE.md instruction.
- **Cost:** ~one Gemini embedding call (~$0.00013 at 3072 dims). No LLM completion call.

## Operator Override

If the user passes an operator as an argument (`/snapshot-dev system`, `/snapshot-dev Brandon-DEV`), use that. Otherwise default to `Brandon`.

## What To Capture

The `assistant_response` field becomes the snapshot body. Future semantic search hits this. Be comprehensive enough that a fresh session searching for the work can fully reconstruct context. Include:

- **What problem was solved** (one paragraph)
- **Files created** (path + line count + one-line description per file)
- **Files modified** (path + nature of change)
- **Architecture choices worth remembering** (especially non-obvious ones — gotchas, scope nuances, invariants)
- **Test totals** (how many tests, all passing?)
- **Verification evidence** (probe results, log lines, build output summary)
- **Search hint phrases** ("Search this snapshot via X, Y, Z") so future-Claude can grep semantically

## Procedure

```bash
# 1. Build the JSON payload as a heredoc-to-file (avoids shell-quoting hell with embedded JSON)
cat > /tmp/snap_payload.json <<'EOF'
{
  "operator": "Brandon",
  "user_message": "<one-line framing of the work being snapshotted>",
  "assistant_response": "<the full structured summary — see What To Capture above>",
  "model": "claude-opus-4-7",
  "tokens": {"prompt": 0, "completion": 0}
}
EOF

# 2. POST to /chat/save
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:9091/chat/save \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data-binary @/tmp/snap_payload.json | python3 -m json.tool

# Expected response:
#   {
#     "success": true,
#     "operator": "Brandon",
#     "minted": true,
#     "snap_id": "SNAP-YYYYMMDD-NNNN",
#     ...
#   }

# 3. Verify embedding generated (proof point — must show 3072 dimensions, not "Failed")
sudo journalctl -u blackbox.service --since "30 seconds ago" --no-pager 2>&1 | \
  grep -E "MINT|EMBEDDING|SNAP-YYYYMMDD-NNNN" | head -10
```

**IMPORTANT:** If `Write` to `/tmp` fails or shell quoting blocks long content, fall back to writing the payload via the `Write` tool to `/tmp/snap_payload.json`, then `curl --data-binary @/tmp/snap_payload.json`. JSON inside `-d '{...}'` shell-single-quotes is fragile for multi-paragraph bodies — use the file path.

## Reporting Back

When the snapshot mints, report to the user:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **snap_id** | `SNAP-YYYYMMDD-NNNN` |
| **operator** | (the one used) |
| **embedding** | 3072 dimensions ✓ (or warn if `Failed to generate`) |
| **media artifacts** | (count if any auto-attached) |
| **search hint** | (1-2 phrases the user can grep for later) |

## Anti-Patterns (do NOT do)

- ❌ Don't POST to `/chat` (LLM round-trip, ~$0.05+ per call vs ~$0.0001 for /chat/save).
- ❌ Don't manually call `/mint` afterward — auto-mint already fired, you'd create a duplicate.
- ❌ Don't AskUserQuestion for the operator unless explicitly told to — default to `Brandon` and let the user override via slash arg.
- ❌ Don't truncate the summary — semantic search quality depends on full context. The 30k char cap is a hard ceiling, not a target.
- ❌ Don't use stale model names (`gemini-2.5-pro`, `text-embedding-004`). Current defaults: `gemini-3.1-pro-preview-customtools` (chat), `gemini-embedding-001` (embeddings). The `model` field in the SaveRequest is just metadata; use whichever model actually produced the response (e.g. `claude-opus-4-7`).

## When To Auto-Trigger (per CLAUDE.md)

Per the updated CLAUDE.md, invoke this at the end of:
- Completing a multi-step plan (this session's "Android context retrieval pipeline fix" was a perfect example)
- Wrapping a meaningful debugging session (root cause found and fixed)
- Major refactor or feature landing
- Any task involving 3+ files modified

Skip for:
- Trivial Q&A ("yes", "what does X do")
- Single-file typo fixes
- Pure exploration with no code changes
- Tasks the user hasn't asked you to record
