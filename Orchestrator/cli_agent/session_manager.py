# --- Per-provider post-attach hooks --------------------------------------
#
# After a tmux session is created and the inner CLI has had time to come
# online, we may need to send a one-time keystroke sequence to nudge the
# CLI into the configuration we want. The classic example is Claude Code,
# which boots in alt-screen mode by default — PgUp/PgDn cannot scroll the
# conversation history in that mode because the bytes never get retained
# outside Claude's process. The fullscreen renderer (Claude's `/tui
# fullscreen` slash command) manages its own scroll buffer instead.
#
# Each value is a list of strings that gets passed verbatim to
# `tmux send-keys -t <name> ...`. tmux interprets bare strings as text
# to type and bracketed names like "Enter" / "C-c" / "Escape" as keys.
#
# Adding a new provider? Two rules:
#   1. Only add an entry if the provider has a real first-run hook.
#      A provider that needs no hook should NOT appear in this table —
#      `None` (i.e., absence) is the default and that is correct.
#   2. The hook must be idempotent: it gets queued onto the inner pty
#      even if the CLI hasn't finished booting, and runs whenever it
#      drains. Don't put state-mutating commands here.
#
# Keys MUST be a subset of cli_agent_routes.PROVIDER_BIN — adding a hook
# for an unregistered provider is dead code (the route layer rejects it).
POST_ATTACH_HOOKS: dict[str, list[str]] = {
    "claude": ["/tui fullscreen", "Enter"],
    # "gemini" deliberately absent — Ink renderer manages scroll fine.
    # "codex"  deliberately absent — pending real-world verification.

# --- Spawn-time PATH augmentation ----------------------------------------
#
# The orchestrator runs under systemd with a restricted PATH that omits
# user-local install dirs (~/.local/bin) and per-version nvm dirs
# (~/.nvm/versions/node/<ver>/bin). The bridge resolves the provider
# binary itself via cli_agent_routes._resolve_provider_bin, but that's
# only enough for tmux to spawn the entry-point script. The script can
# still fail at exec time if its shebang relies on PATH — Gemini CLI's
# `#!/usr/bin/env node` is the canonical example: `gemini` is found,
# then `node` is not, and the shebang resolution fails before Gemini
# even runs.
#
# So we extend the PATH that tmux passes to the inner command to include
# the same nvm dirs the resolver searches. Keep this in sync with
# cli_agent_routes._resolve_provider_bin's search list.
def _augmented_spawn_path() -> str:
    """Build a PATH that includes nvm node version bin dirs.

    `node` for the shebang lookup to succeed.
