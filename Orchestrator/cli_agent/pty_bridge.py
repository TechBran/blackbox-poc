    This is the critical correctness fix: the previous implementation called
    a blocking `_proc.read()` inside `run_in_executor` and used
    `asyncio.wait_for` to time it out. That doesn't actually stop the thread
    — Python's ThreadPoolExecutor cannot cancel a thread blocked in
    `os.read()`. So every timed-out read leaked one thread (held until the
    PTY produced a byte, which the orphan thread then consumed — silently
    dropping the data on the floor while the caller had moved on).

    Using `select` inside the executor lets the kernel itself enforce the
    timeout. The thread always returns within `timeout` seconds, freeing
    its pool slot. No leaks, no dropped bytes, no starvation.
