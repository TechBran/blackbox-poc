"""Shared fossil-context retrieval builder.

Single source of truth for the four-source fossil retrieval pipeline used by
`/chat/stream` (and, going forward, by voice / agent-WebSocket routes).

Transport-agnostic: this module does NOT build the final message list, does NOT
add device-registry context, and does NOT assemble a system prompt. Those
concerns live with each caller because they vary by transport.

Contract:
    build_fossil_context(user_text, operator, log_prefix="[CONTEXT]")
        -> (fossil_context_str, provenance_dict)

    provenance_dict keys: "recent", "keyword", "semantic", "checkpoint"
    (each a list of snap_ids, may be empty).

Per-operator scoping is a first-class invariant: retrieval helpers are invoked
with the caller-provided operator, and a missing/unknown operator returns
empty lists for all four sources.

    #     under-attend to content in the trailing region. Earlier ordering

    #     checkpoints" at byte ~165K of a 173K fossil_context — the

    # Final order: checkpoint (at top, hot attention region) → recent →
    # semantic → keyword. Checkpoints are compressed session summaries
    # that benefit from being visually prominent. Query-specific
    # retrieval (recent/semantic/keyword) trails — still survives at 200K
    # cap, and recent items are typically more recoverable from operator
    # state if they ever clip.
